# Auto Clicker

> ### **If you are an employer:**
> AutoHotkey is a software used to create automated computer inputs. It has its own programming language which was unlike anything I had experience with. I had to read the [documentation](https://www.autohotkey.com/docs/AutoHotkey.htm), which is pretty clear and detailed. **The goal of this project was to introduce myself to AutoHotkey meanwhile creating a script that helps me with certain video games.**  
> Only relevant part is [AutoClicker.ahk](AutoClicker.ahk) which includes all the code.

Here is a AutoHotkey script that lets you choose an amount of clicks and the interval between them to click that many times automatically. I used this to level up my skills in video game **Valheim**.

## How to use:
You have to [download AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and install it first. After that, download AutoClicker and run it.

Press the `+` on your keypad. A window will pop up and ask you how many times you want to click. Just pressing `enter` will default to 100. After that, a second one will pop up and ask you the interval between each click **in miliseconds**. Default is 1000, which is a second.

Clicking will start now and a text bubble will show you how many clicks you have left. You can press `-` on your keypad to cancel clicking anytime.
